 ftr_ic_event.0002.desc:0 "For a long time, my child [first_suc.GetShortUIName|U] has been groomed as my successor. However, as [second_suc.GetShortUIName|U] has gradually grown up, [second_suc.GetHerHis] popularity has gradually caught up with [first_suc.GetShortUIName|U]. Perhaps I shouldn't have shown my hesitation openly or secretly, but now the competition between these two children has become an open secret. The subjects' discussions about the successor have made me irritated and uneasy, and I can't help but worry about my authority and the stability of the kingdom.

Now that I am growing stronger, I am fully capable of making a final desperate attempt. I can't help but wonder whether I should take measures to reverse the situation. "
